# Cybode - Decoding the social media 


# Our Features :

The these three features are proposed by us.
- Databind : a lookup tool that uses OSINT to get user data on different parameters
like username, email, name. etc
- Detectron : a detection tool that will fetch data from news url and give a detailed overview of it with summary, visulaization,
  analysis, detect propoganda, hate speech, etc.
- Demystify : To analyse the patterns/trends of social media and classify them according
to some predefined fields like - most active, most used, hate speech,etc.
To understand the social activity and decode the patterns behind them. Also, the
individual can be identified with the most hate speech used related to any topic.

 **Technology stack**: We will be using flask for the backend and next.js for the frontend.

## How to Contribute

1. Choose an issue, bug, exploit, or feature to work on: Start by identifying an issue or feature in the repository that you would like to work on. If you can't find an existing issue or feature, you can create a new one.

2. Fork the repository: Once you have identified an issue or feature to work on, you will need to fork the repository. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

3. Clone the repository: Next, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by using the git clone command and specifying the URL of the repository.

4. Create a new branch: Before making any changes, you should create a new branch in your local repository. This will keep your changes separate from the main branch of the repository and make it easier to submit a pull request later on.

5. Make your changes: Now you can make your changes to the code in your local branch. Be sure to follow the project's coding style and conventions.

6. Test your changes: Once you have made your changes, be sure to test them thoroughly to ensure that they work as intended and do not introduce new issues or bugs.

7. Commit your changes: Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to your local branch using the git commit command.

8. Push your changes: Once you have committed your changes, push them to your forked repository on GitHub using the git push command.

9. Open a pull request: Finally, open a pull request to merge your changes into the staging branch of the repository. Be sure to describe your changes and explain why they are necessary or beneficial. Note that the project maintainers may request changes or reject your pull request, so your first pull request is not guaranteed to be accepted.

> It's also worth noting that you should communicate with the project maintainers and other contributors to ensure that your changes align with the project's goals and direction.
